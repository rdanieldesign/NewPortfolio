## Richard Daniel's Portfolio Site

I built this site as a way to display my design and development work. It's also served as a means for experimentation with new dev tools and code.

#### Libraries used:

  * jQuery
  * Handlebars
  * Modernizr

#### How to use it
  * Clone my repo
  * Run `npm install`
  * Run `bower install`
